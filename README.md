## Introduction

DNA heterogeneity refers to the variations and differences found within the DNA sequences of different individuals or species. This project aims to analyze these variations to gain insights into genetic diversity and its implications.

## Features

- Analysis of DNA sequence variations
- Visualization of DNA heterogeneity
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Data preprocessing and cleaning

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaochongYANG/dna_heterogeneity.git
