## Introduction

DNA heterogeneity refers to the variations and differences found within the DNA sequences of different individuals or species. This project aims to analyze these variations to gain insights into genetic diversity and its implications.

## Features

- Analysis of DNA sequence variations
- Visualization of DNA heterogeneity
- Statistical analysis and modelling
- Data preprocessing and cleaning

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaochongYANG/dna_heterogeneity.git
cd dna_heterogeneity
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

dataset.ipynb is used for loading and pre-cleaning the dataset, analysis.ipynb is used for the analysis.

## Data

GM12878, HAP1, Hela, and K562 each represent one type of cell, and the .txt files contained in each directory represent one cell of that type.
